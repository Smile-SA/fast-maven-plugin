				As some browser doesn't like you to play with local file, you may want to test your work through a web server.
				For example, if you use tools like the excelent <a href="http://leaverou.github.com/prefixfree">-prefix-free</a>, you may find it useful =)
			</p>
			<p>
				To do so, we don't need to install anything, we simply will use command line interface (CLI) :
				<source><![CDATA[
cd $PROJECT_HOME
mvn jetty:run
]]></source>
				Then, you can access <a href="http://localhost:8008">http://localhost:8008</a> in your browser.
